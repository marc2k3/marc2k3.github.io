# Playlist Fix
[Download :material-download:](https://github.com/marc2k3/marc2k3/releases){ .md-button }

## Overview
This aims to provide similar functionality to `foo_playlist_revive`. It uses
title formatting to match dead playlist items against library items and updates
the playlist entries.

## Usage
Before using, check the main `Preferences>Tools>Playlist Fix`. You can view/add your
own title formatting presets.

There are 4 main menu commands under `File>Playlist Fix`.

```
Fix active playlist
Fix all playlists
Check active playlist
Check all playlists
```

!!! note
	The `check` options will generate a report without making any changes.

Because playlist operations are only permitted in the main thread, it may appear
to block the UI if used on large libraries/playlists. There is no way around that.

The report may look something like [this](../images/playlist-fix.png).
