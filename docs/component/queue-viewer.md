# Queue Viewer
[Download :material-download:](https://github.com/marc2k3/marc2k3/releases){ .md-button }

## Overview
This provides full playback queue management as an embedded UI element for `Default UI`
and `Columns UI`. There is also a standalone popup window available from the `View` menu.

There is full drag/drop support from other playlist / library viewer selections. You
can select single or multiple items to re-arrange or remove them entirely.

Unlike the original `foo_queuecontents` component, there is no support for multiple columns
but the `Item` column supports custom title formatting.

By right clicking on the column headers, you can set the title format pattern used
for the `Item` column, choose to `Keep queue on close` and sort the entire queue
by randomising or reverse.

## Usage
It is assumed you know how to add UI elements to your layout. Basic guides
can be found below.

[Default UI](http://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=Foobar2000:Layout_Editing_Mode)

[Columns UI](https://wiki.yuo.be/columns_ui:config:layout)

In addition to the drag/drop capabilities mentioned above, you can also right click any
playlist or library selection and use these new commands found under the `Queue Viewer` sub-menu:

```
Send to playback queue
Send to playback queue and play
Add to front of playback queue
Add to front of playback queue and play
```

The `Send` commands flush exisiting queue items first.

!!! note
	If menu items appear to be hidden, it's because the queue is limited to a maximum of 256
	tracks.

### 1.0.16
- Add new context commands for adding playlist / library viewer selections to the front of
the queue while keeping existing queue items.

### 1.0.15
