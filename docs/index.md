All components require [foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org) `2.1+` with
the exception of `OptimFROG Decoder` which requires `1.6.0+`.

`Cover Utils` requires `Windows 8.1+`. All others require `Windows 7+`.

!!! note
	I will fix bugs if they're reported and can be easily
	reproduced. It's unlikely I'll be adding new features.
